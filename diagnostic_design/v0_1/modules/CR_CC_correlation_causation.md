## What this module is for

This module addresses a common reasoning shortcut:

You notice that two things tend to appear together, and you move quickly from pattern to **cause**.

This shows up everywhere:

- Cities with more police have more crime.
- People who exercise more report higher happiness.
- Companies that adopt a certain strategy grow faster.
- Students who study longer perform better.

The pattern feels meaningful (and it often is). But moving from “these things co-occur” to “this causes that” is a larger step than it appears at first.

The goal of this module is to help you slow that step down and understand what is required before treating a pattern as a lever.

## The core mistake

The mistake here is well known: treating association as explanation.

When two variables move together, several possibilities exist:

- One may influence the other.
- The direction of influence may be reversed.
- A third factor may influence both.
- The pattern may emerge from selection effects.

Without distinguishing these possibilities, a pattern becomes a story. And once a story forms, it becomes easy to design actions around it. That is where the danger for our critical thinking lies.

## Key idea 1: Direction matters

If A and B move together, which direction runs?

Consider:

- Do happier people exercise more, or does exercise increase happiness?
- Do wealthy neighborhoods attract better schools, or do better schools raise the wealth of a neighborhood?

Policy and personal decisions can easily miss their target when the direction is unclear. Assuming direction without testing it creates confident but fragile plans. We have to make sure to avoid this.

---

## Key idea 2: Hidden variables manufacture patterns

Sometimes two things move together because they share a cause.

For example:

- Ice cream sales and drowning deaths both rise in summer.
- Stress and coffee consumption often increase together.
- Tech adoption and productivity may correlate because of underlying investment trends.

There are always visible and invisible forces (variables). If you intervene on the visible variable while ignoring the hidden one, you'll change little.

Correlation can be a surface signal of deeper structure. As critical thinkers, we have to understand this structure.

---

## Key idea 3: A pattern is not yet a lever

Many patterns describe the world without offering a way to change it.

Knowing that high performers tend to have certain traits does not mean adopting those traits will produce the same outcome. The traits may be effects rather than causes. They may depend on background conditions you cannot replicate.

The key question that matters is:

_If I deliberately change this variable, should I expect the outcome to change?_

You do not yet have a strategy until that question is examined.

---

## The causal pause (skill drill)

Take a pattern you find persuasive.

Write answers to:

1. What exactly is the association?
2. What are at least two alternative explanations for this pattern?
3. What hidden variable might influence both sides?
4. If I changed one variable intentionally, why should the other change?

If you cannot generate alternative explanations, you are likely too attached to the first story.

---

## Common failure patterns

You may recognize some of these:

- Designing actions based purely on observed correlations
- Treating statistical reports as proof of mechanism
- Overlooking background conditions that produce the pattern
- Feeling surprised when “evidence-based” changes fail

These failures are often not due to bad intentions, but to incomplete causal reasoning.

---

## Reframe: what patterns are actually for

Patterns are signals.

They suggest where to look more closely, help us narrow our attention, and finally, generate some hypotheses.

They do not automatically justify action.

Before acting on a pattern, you must ask whether it reflects:

- Mechanism,
- Coincidence,
- Shared causes,
- Or structural constraints.

Only some patterns can be turned into levers.

---

## Practice prompts

Choose a claim you have recently found convincing because “studies show” or “data suggests.”

Write:

- What exactly is being correlated?
- What is the proposed direction of influence?
- What other explanation might account for the same pattern?
- What experiment or change would clarify the direction?

You do not need laboratory precision. You need structural clarity.

---

## What not to overcorrect into

A word of warning: this module is not arguing that correlations are useless.

Correlations are often the first signal that something important is happening.

But treating them as causal proof invites fragile reasoning.

We never want to be skeptical of the data. We just need more discipline in interpreting it.

---

## Completion condition

You have completed this module when you:

- Notice when you are jumping from pattern to mechanism
- Generate alternative explanations before committing
- Ask whether a pattern can realistically be turned into a lever

At that point, data becomes **the beginning of inquiry**, rather than the end of it.
