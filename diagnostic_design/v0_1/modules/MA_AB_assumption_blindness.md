## What this module is for

This module addresses a problem that shows up most clearly in disagreement.

You and someone else can look at the same situation, agree on many of the facts, follow what appears to be reasonable logic, and still reach very different conclusions. The conversation goes in circles. Each side feels the other is “missing something obvious.”

Often, what’s missing is awareness of **starting assumptions**.

The goal of this module is to help you notice the assumptions you rely on so automatically that they don’t feel like assumptions at all.

---

## The core mistake

The mistake is treating assumptions as if they were observations.

Every argument starts somewhere. It relies on background ideas about what matters, how people behave, what counts as success or failure, what is normal, acceptable, or realistic. Most of these ideas are never stated explicitly.

When assumptions stay invisible, these things usually happen:

- Disagreement feels irrational
- Explanations feel self-evident
- Surprise becomes common when plans fail

You end up reasoning carefully from premises you never chose.

---

## Key idea 1: Logic rarely causes disagreement

When people argue past each other, it is tempting to think that:

- One side is being emotional
- One side is uninformed
- One side is reasoning poorly

Sometimes that’s true. Often it isn’t.

More often, people are applying similar reasoning to **different starting points**:

- Different definitions of fairness
- Different expectations about human behavior
- Different views of responsibility, risk, or obligation

If you don’t see the starting points, the disagreement looks mysterious.

---

## Key idea 2: Assumptions hide in definitions and defaults

Assumptions often live inside ordinary words.

Words like:

- “success”
- “responsibility”
- “reasonable”
- “safe”
- “normal”

sound descriptive, but they often encode judgments.

Two people can agree on all the facts and still disagree because they are using the same words to mean different things. When this happens, arguments generate heat but no traction.

---

## Key idea 3: Surprise is a diagnostic signal

One of the clearest signs of assumption blindness is surprise.

If a plan fails despite “good reasoning,” you should ask the following questions:

- What did I assume would stay constant?
- What behavior did I take for granted?
- What incentives or constraints did I ignore?

Surprise often marks the boundary between what you reasoned about and what you assumed away.

---

## The assumption audit (skill drill)

Take a belief or plan you feel confident about.

Write down answers to:

1. What must be true for this to work?
2. What am I assuming about people’s behavior?
3. What am I assuming about constraints, incentives, or norms?
4. Which of these assumptions would others reasonably reject?

This exercise is about making the invisible visible.

---

## Common failure patterns

You may recognize some of these:

- Treating disagreement as ignorance rather than difference
- Being surprised when “obvious” solutions fail
- Repeating the same argument without progress
- Feeling frustrated that others “just don’t get it”

These patterns often signal that assumptions are doing more work than evidence.

---

## Reframe: what assumptions are actually for

Don't think that assumptions are flaws. They're not. They are a necessary reasoning building block. You cannot reason from nothing. You need starting points.

The problems occur when we forget that we have assumptions that underlie our thinking. It is very important to shine light on what these assumptions are. You must be aware of them.

Once assumptions are visible, they can be:

- Questioned
- Compared
- Adjusted
- Negotiated

Invisible assumptions can’t be examined at all.

---

## Practice prompts

Choose a disagreement you’ve had with somebody recently.

Answer, in writing:

- What did I assume the other person shared?
- What did they seem to assume that I did not?
- Which assumptions were never stated out loud?
- How would the disagreement change if we surfaced them?

You may find that the argument was never really about the conclusion.

---

## What not to overcorrect into

A word of warning: this module is **not** advocating for:

- Radical relativism
- Treating all assumptions as equally valid
- Avoiding disagreement

Some assumptions are better grounded than others.

The goal here is clarity about them.

---

## Completion condition

You have completed this module when you:

- Notice assumptions while reasoning, not only after failure
- Can identify where disagreement starts, not just where it ends
- Feel less puzzled by persistent disagreement

At that point, reasoning becomes less brittle, and disagreement becomes more informative.
