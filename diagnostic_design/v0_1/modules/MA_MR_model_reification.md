## What this module is for

This module addresses a common way intelligent people get stuck:

You rely on a particular way of explaining the world (maybe an ideology, a moral framework, a cultural story, a psychological theory, or a religious worldview) and over time it starts to feel less like an explanation and more like reality itself.

This usually happens gradually.

At first, the explanation helps. It brings order, it makes events intelligible, and perhaps it gives you language to describe what you see around you. But as you keep using it, you begin to interpret more and more situations through it automatically.

Eventually, the explanation stops feeling like a tool and starts feeling like “how things really are.”

This is called 'reification.'

The goal of this module is to help you **use explanations without being used by them**.

## The core mistake

The mistake here is forgetting that explanations are **simplifications**, lenses that highlight some features of reality while ignoring others, and not exhaustive descriptions of reality.

When we explain things or think about explanations given by others, we should always ask these questions:

- What does this leave out?
- Where does this stop working?
- Under what conditions does this break down?

But, reification makes us stop asking these because it ignores information that doesn't align with the explanation. Mismatches get absorbed, reinterpreted, or dismissed, and anything that doesn’t fit is treated as an exception, or noise.

Over time, this produces confidence without friction, which is usually a warning sign.

## Key idea 1: Explanations are compressions

Every explanation _compresses_ reality.

It takes something complex and reduces it to a smaller set of variables, motives, or forces. That’s why explanations are useful in the first place. Without compression, thinking would be impossible.

But compression always involves loss.

If an explanation feels like it explains _everything_, that usually means you’ve stopped noticing what it excludes.

Good explanations always clarify. Bad ones flatten the entire field into a single theme.

---

## Key idea 2: Fit is not truth

An explanation can fit many situations without being literally true.

Ideologies, psychological theories, cultural narratives, and moral frameworks are especially good at this. They are flexible, in the sense that they can reinterpret almost any outcome in a way that preserves the story.

When this happens, the explanation becomes hard to test. There's is no way to evaluate it against reality because it has learned how to bend itself to survive any contact with reality.

At that point, the fit causes insulation: your critical faculties become dull, and you can't properly evaluate any explanation.

---

## Key idea 3: Overreach shows up in how disagreement feels

One way to detect reification is emotional.

When someone challenges your explanation, notice if some of these things happen to you:

- Does the challenge feel like confusion, or like a threat?
- Do you feel the urge to correct them, educate them, or dismiss them?
- Does disagreement feel like ignorance on their part rather than a genuine difference in perspective?

These reactions often signal that an explanation has become **entangled with certainty**, rather than held provisionally.

---

## The boundary check (skill drill)

Take an explanation you rely on often.

Force yourself to answer, in writing:

1. What does this explanation handle well?
2. What kinds of situations does it clearly _not_ explain?
3. What would count as a serious challenge to it?
4. In what situations would I deliberately set it aside?

If these questions feel hard or unnatural, the explanation may be doing more than explaining.

---

## Common failure patterns

You may recognize some of these:

- Explaining away counterexamples instead of learning from them
- Treating disagreement as ignorance or bad faith
- Applying the same framework across domains where it was never designed to work
- Feeling disoriented or defensive when the explanation is questioned

These are signs of overcommitment to specific explanations.

---

## Reframe: what explanations are actually for

Explanations are _tools for orientation_, not mirrors of reality.

They are meant to:

- Help you notice patterns
- Guide attention
- Suggest possible actions

They are not meant to:

- Settle questions once and for all
- Explain everything equally well
- Replace judgment

If an explanation stops being optional, it stops being useful. It's not an explanation anymore, but an ideology.

---

## Practice prompts

Choose one explanation about an aspect of reality you lean on heavily. It can be about society, politics, your job, existence, anything.

Write brief answers to:

- When did I start using this explanation?
- What problem did it help me solve at the time?
- Where do I feel uneasy or strained applying it now?
- What alternative explanations might also be partially true?

This practice doesn't ask you to abandon the explanation. What you need is just some distance from it, so you can see it in a better light.

---

## What not to overcorrect into

A word of warning: this module is **not** arguing for:

- Explanation-hopping
- Radical skepticism
- Refusing to commit to any framework

Some explanations are genuinely better than others. We should acknowledge that. Relativism is a logical error. So, the goal here is **control** over your commitments to some explanations.

---

## Completion condition

You have completed this module when you:

- Can articulate where a favored explanation stops working
- Can hold it as a useful lens rather than a description of reality
- Feel less threatened by alternative ways of making sense of the same situation

At that point, explanations return to their proper role: tools you use, not truths you serve.
