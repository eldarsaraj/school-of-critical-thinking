## What this module is for

This module addresses a problem many people today face: being open minded too much.

I know open-mindedness is usually considered a virtue, but sometimes it can prevent us from thinking better.

For example, you encounter multiple explanations for a situation (be it economic, psychological, cultural, structural, or moral) and each one seems plausible. Depending on the context, a different explanation feels convincing.

So, instead of committing, you rotate between them.

I understand how this can feel sophisticated, or even feel intellectually open-minded. But over time, it produces a strange kind of drift: you can explain many things, yet struggle to decide what to do.

The goal of this module is to help you move from **collecting explanations** to **evaluating and selecting them**.

---

## The core mistake

The crucial mistake here is **confusing plausibility with usefulness**.

Many explanations are plausible. They fit the facts reasonably well and sound coherent overall, they can even coexist without obvious contradictions. So, we keep many of them in rotation, because we can't really decide which one of them is the best.

But explanations are not Pokemon cards to be collected. We have to understand them as tools, and tools are chosen for the occasion. We can't just switch between them to suit our circumstances.

When you keep switching frameworks of explanation, then:

- Your conclusions shift depending on mood or audience
- Accountability weakens, you stop being responsible for what happens
- Your action becomes inconsistent and long-term goals suffer

What happens in the end is that you remain intellectually busy but practically unstable.

---

## Key idea 1: Explanations should guide prediction

A useful explanation should allow you to anticipate something.

To get there, ask these questions:

- If this explanation is accurate, what should I expect to see next?
- What patterns would follow from it?
- What would count as evidence against it?

If an explanation cannot guide expectations, it is functioning more like commentary than analysis.

Prediction requires direction, and it's the job of explanations to guide it.

---

## Key idea 2: Explanations should guide action

Explanations are also decision devices.

If two explanations lead you to take the same action, their practical difference may not matter. If they lead to very different actions, then choosing between them becomes important.

When you switch explanations opportunistically, you often adjust them to justify what you already want to do.

Over time, this erodes clarity. You are no longer selecting, but _recruiting_ explanations. That's not critical thinking.

---

## Key idea 3: Criteria reduce drift

If this describes your situation, what you need is _criteria_.

Switching explanations is not a bad thing per se, if you have clear criteria for doing so. Without criteria, switching feels harmless, but with them, choice is clear and intentional. That's what we want.

Some possible criteria:

- Does the explanation account for most relevant evidence?
- Does it make testable claims?
- Does it compress reality without oversimplifying it?
- Does it generate useful constraints on action?

You do not need a perfect scoring system. You need some explicit standards.

---

## The explanation scorecard (skill drill)

Take a situation where you have entertained multiple explanations.

For each explanation, write brief answers to:

1. What does this explanation predict?
2. What action would follow from taking it seriously?
3. What evidence would weaken it?
4. Where does it clearly fall short?

Once you do this, switching will become concrete and backed by clear criteria and good reasons.

---

## Common failure patterns

You may recognize some of these:

- Adopting one framework in one conversation and a different one in another
- Using explanations selectively to support pre-existing conclusions
- Feeling intellectually flexible but strategically uncertain
- Avoiding commitment because alternatives remain conceivable

These habits often masquerade as sophistication, but they are far from it. They make you vacillate between beliefs, never anchoring yourself in firm ground.

---

## Reframe: what choosing an explanation actually means

Choosing an explanation does not mean believing it absolutely.

It means deciding:

- This is the most useful framework for now.
- I will use it consistently unless evidence shifts.
- I will accept the consequences it implies.

Commitment should be downstream from coherence. Without it, your reasoning fragments.

---

## Practice prompts

Think of an issue where you regularly switch explanations.

Write:

- Which explanation do I default to when alone?
- Which explanation do I use in public?
- What action would each explanation demand?
- If I had to choose one for the next six months, which would it be and why?

If you sense some discomfort here, that should be your signal. Listen to it.

---

## What not to overcorrect into

A word of warning: this module is not advocating:

- Dogmatism
- Ignoring alternative explanations
- Forcing premature certainty

Multiple explanations can contain partial truth, so we don't want exclusivity. You have to be a discipline selector of explanations.

---

## Completion condition

You have completed this module when you:

- Can articulate why you prefer one explanation over alternatives
- Apply it consistently rather than opportunistically
- Remain open to revision without drifting between frameworks

At that point, your explanations become commitments you examine. And, as Socrates was credited with saying, "An unexamined life is not worth living." Live your life examined.
