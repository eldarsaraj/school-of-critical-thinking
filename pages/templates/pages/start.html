<h1>Start</h1>

<p>
  The School of Critical Thinking is a small practice-driven organization focused on helping you think clearly and access the right resources to do so.
  We rebuild thinking from first principles for a world where answers are cheap and judgment is rare.

    <h2>For adults</h2>
    <p class="start__text">
      Tools can summarize, generate, and calculate faster than any person.
      The scarce skill now is judgment: reasoning under uncertainty, choosing good problems,
      and making decisions when there is no obvious answer.
    </p>
    <p class="start__text">
      The School works with adults who want to strengthen those foundations, not to compete with machines,
      but to think where machines cannot.

    <h2>For parents</h2>
    <p class="start__text">
      Your child is entering a world where information and answers are abundant.
      Advantage will come from how one thinks: framing problems, weighing evidence,
      and handling uncertainty.
    </p>
    <p class="start__text">
      The School works with children and adolescents to develop those skills early, so they grow into thinkers
      who are not dependent on tools, trends, or systems they do not understand.

    <h2>Take the Thinking Diagnostic</h2>
    <p class="start__text">
      Not sure where your reasoning breaks?
      This short diagnostic identifies the structural constraints in your thinking:
      uncertainty, causality, abstraction, or epistemic humility.
    </p>
    <p class="start__text">
      You’ll receive a personalized syllabus and repair plan based on your actual decision patterns.
