<h1>About the School</h1>

<p>
Critical thinking is usually taught as an academic skill:
analyzing texts, spotting fallacies, debating abstract claims.
That version made sense in a world where information was scarce
and decisions unfolded slowly.
</p>

<p>
That world no longer exists.
</p>

  <p class="about-block__label">Why critical thinking must change</p>

  <p class="about-block__text">
    Today, answers are abundant. AI can generate arguments, summaries,
    explanations, and solutions faster than any human.
    What it cannot replace—yet—is responsibility for choice.
  </p>

  <p class="about-block__text">
    The central problem is no longer <em>what is true</em> in theory,
    but <em>what to do</em> under uncertainty: when information is incomplete,
    incentives are misaligned, and mistakes are costly.
  </p>

  <p class="about-block__label">Our approach</p>

  <p class="about-block__text">
    The School of Critical Thinking teaches critical thinking as
    <em>agency</em>: the capacity to act deliberately in situations where
    rules are unclear, outcomes are probabilistic, and no authority can decide for you.
  </p>

  <p class="about-block__text">
    We focus on the thinking layer beneath content:
    how judgments are formed, how confidence becomes misplaced,
    how reasoning breaks under pressure, and how to design decisions
    that remain robust even when you are wrong.
  </p>

  <p class="about-block__label">What this looks like in practice</p>

  <p class="about-block__text">
    This is not abstract philosophy and not generic productivity advice.
    It is applied reasoning, trained through concrete problems:
    risk, tradeoffs, long-term consequences, and second-order effects. At the School, we provide:
  </p>

  <ul class="about-list">
    <li>Articles that demonstrate the method on real decisions.</li>
    <li>Books that systematize thinking tools and mental models.</li>
    <li>Instruction and consulting that adapt the framework to individual constraints.</li>
    <li>Tutoring that builds durable reasoning skills rather than test performance alone.</li>
  </ul>

<section class="about-block">
  <p class="about-block__label">Why this matters now</p>

  <p class="about-block__text">
    Many people feel that something is missing because traditional education did not prepare them for a world
    where machines think faster and environments change continuously.
  </p>

  <p class="about-block__text">
    The goal of the School is not to compete with AI at producing answers,
    but to train humans to remain decisive, adaptive, and responsible thinkers in an AI-augmented world.
    The real moat is not information, but the ability to navigate uncertainty and complexity with confidence and clarity.

  <p class="about-founder__label">Founder perspective</p>

  <p class="about-founder__text">
    I built this School out of a practical frustration: formal education often doesn't teach people how to think clearly and act decisively in complex, uncertain environments.
    There's too much emphasis on memorization, abstract analysis, and theoretical knowledge, and not enough on applied reasoning, decision-making under pressure, and understanding one's own cognitive blind spots.
  </p>

  <p class="about-founder__text">
    My background is in philosophy, but the School is not “philosophy class.”
    Philosophy is useful here because it forces first-principles thinking.
    The mission is to give you thinking tools that convert into agency, 
    in work, in education, and in life.
