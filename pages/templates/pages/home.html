  <h1>Education teaches content. It doesn’t teach thinking.</h1>

  <p>
    The School of Critical Thinking exists to rebuild thinking from first principles,
    not for knowledge, but for agency: the ability to choose well when information is incomplete
    and the stakes are real.
  </p>

  <p>Most real decisions look simpler than they are.</p>

      Most people can choose. But, fewer can justify the choice without resorting to intuition,
      'vibes', or fear. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The problem here is a lack of structure: a first-principles way to reason about risk, uncertainty,
      tradeoffs, and consequences.“Being smart” is not helpful if there's no system to apply it in.
    </p>

    <p>
      The advance of AI makes this problem unavoidable. When answers become cheap, the scarce skill is judgment. 
      When all the information is available at the click of a button, the bottleneck becomes <strong>asking the right question</strong>, knowing which answer to trust, and being able to apply it in the real world.

  <section class="home-offer">
    <h2>What we teach</h2>
    <p>
      We believe critical thinking is about <strong>structural alignment of our minds with reality</strong>. 
      The goal is not to have more information, but to have a better internal model of how the world works, and where our blindspots are. 
      
      That's why we focus on the layers underneath everyday thinking: how judgments are formed, how errors occur and multiply,
      and how decisions are actually made when you don’t get perfect information.
    </p>

    <p>
      The aim of the School is not academic knowledge. We're focused on action: clearer decisions, better bets,
      fewer self-inflicted disasters.
