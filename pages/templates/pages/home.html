  <h1>Education teaches content. It doesn’t teach thinking.</h1>

  <p>
    The School of Critical Thinking exists to rebuild thinking from first principles,
    not for knowledge, but for agency: the ability to choose well when information is incomplete
    and the stakes are real.
  </p>

  <p>Most real decisions look simpler than they are.</p>

      Choose one. Don’t calculate. Don’t overthink.

        class="home-choice__btn"

        Receive $1,000

    <p>
      Most people can choose. But, fewer can justify the choice without collapsing into intuition,
      vibes, or fear. That isn’t a lack of intelligence.
    </p>

    <p>
      It’s a lack of structure: a first-principles way to reason about risk, uncertainty,
      tradeoffs, and consequences. This is where “being smart” stops helping.
    </p>

    <p>
      AI makes this unavoidable. Answers are now cheap. The scarce skill is judgment.

  <section class="home-offer">
    <h2>What we teach</h2>
    <p>
      We teach the layer underneath subjects: how judgments are formed, how errors propagate,
      and how decisions are actually made when you don’t get perfect information.
    </p>

    <p>
      The output is not opinions. The output is action: clearer decisions, better bets,
      fewer self-inflicted disasters.
