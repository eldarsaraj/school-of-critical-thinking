            "Critical thinking is usually taught as a loose collection of skills—logic, argument "
            "analysis, inference—without a unifying structure. Students often master concepts in theory "
            "yet struggle to apply them in real situations, a gap that the rise of artificial intelligence "
            "has only widened.\n\n"
            "Resisting Entropy proposes a different approach. Rooted in the ancient Platonic method of "
            "truth-seeking, the book reframes critical thinking through a computational lens. It builds "
            "intuition from first principles by focusing on decomposition, abstraction, pattern recognition, "
            "and algorithmic thinking—core ideas borrowed from computer science and applied to perennial "
            "philosophical problems.\n\n"
            "Critical thinking is presented not as abstract intellectual mastery, but as an existential "
            "practice of ordering: resisting the natural drift toward confusion, noise, and disorder. "
            "Each chapter combines visual explanations with substantive exercises, making the book a "
            "practical resource for developing judgment, agency, and decision-making capacity in the age of AI."
