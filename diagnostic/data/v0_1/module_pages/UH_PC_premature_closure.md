## What this module is for

This module addresses a specific failure mode under uncertainty:

Sometimes you reach a conclusion too early. You do that not because the evidence is strong, but because continuing to think feels costly, tiring, or destabilizing for you.

Many people rush to judgment and think this is carelessness or intellectual laziness.

But, actually, it is a response to **cognitive load**, ambiguity, and the desire for closure. Sometimes we simply get overwhelmed with the process and the sheer quantity of information, and we wish to just get it over with.

Being open-minded is a virtue that has a specific goal: you don't want to rush judgment and prematurely close your reasoning process.

The goal of this module is to help you **recognize when your confidence has outpaced your justification**, and how to delay closure without drifting or spiraling. You don't want to deliberate things forever, of course, but you also don't want to rush. Finding that sweet spot is all about balance of reasoning.

## The core mistake

The key mistake here (that we all make, all the time) is confusing _psychological relief_ with _epistemic adequacy_.

Let me explain that. Very often, we feel a **psychological need** to complete some process (project, decision, plan). You may be writing your college essay or a work report for a week or two and you're tired of looking at it anymore. So, you complete it, but not because it was ready, but because your mind wanted the process to just end.

This also happens with our worldviews, beliefs, and ideas in general.

At some point, a view may feel:

- coherent
- stable
- satisfying

That's all good and legitimate. But, that feeling is often mistaken for:

> “This is probably right.”

Sometimes, this coherence is cheap. An explanation may appear complete because you stopped questioning it. But, it could be weak.

In science, this particular problem is called 'the stopping rule.' We have to be deliberate about when to stop doing something.

Premature closure happens when the stopping rule is:

> “This feels good enough.”

Rather than:

> “Further thinking is unlikely to change what I would do.”

## Key idea 1: There are different reasons to stop reasoning

Of course, this doesn't mean that stopping is always wrong. But the **reason** we stop matters. It makes all the difference.

Good stopping reasons:

- You have enough information to act
- Additional thinking would not change your decision
- You have a plan to revisit if needed

Bad stopping reasons:

- The topic feels draining
- Uncertainty is uncomfortable
- The current view fits your identity or social group
- You want to move on and reclaim mental space

So, premature closure is a tactic focused not on _when_ you stop, but on _why_.

---

## Key idea 2: Closure for action ≠ closure for belief

You often need to act before you can know.

But acting does **not** require:

- Treating your belief as final
- Defending it publicly
- Integrating it into your identity

A common error is collapsing:

> “I will act on this for now”

into:

> “This is what I believe.”

This makes later updating psychologically expensive and encourages rationalization instead of revision. Action doesn't have to imply closing your beliefs to any future update. Because action is a way to generate new information, it should serve as a baseline, not a fortress. What you do doesn't always reflect what you believe.

Sometimes you do things so you could _learn what to believe_.

---

## Key idea 3: Confidence should track fragility, not coherence

A belief can feel solid and coherent while resting on fragile foundations.

To determine if you're confident about something because it sounds coherent, or it is based on solid ground, ask these questions:

- How dependent is this view on a few key assumptions?
- What evidence, if true, would seriously weaken it?
- Am I confident because the assumptions and evidence are strong, or because alternatives feel messy?

Confidence that ignores fragility is just inertia. You may be fooling yourself that you have the answer, when you actually might not.

---

## The stopping-rule check (skill drill)

Time for practice.

Before settling on a view, force yourself to answer:

1. What _specific_ evidence would make me reconsider this?
2. Is that evidence imaginable, or merely rhetorical?
3. Would I actually notice it if it appeared?
4. Am I stopping because further thinking won’t help, or because it’s uncomfortable?

If you cannot answer these clearly, closure is likely premature.

---

## Common failure patterns

You may recognize yourself here:

- Feeling relieved once you “pick a side”
- Treating open questions as distractions rather than signals
- Confusing decisiveness with rigor
- Defending a view mainly because revisiting it feels exhausting

These are cognitive shortcuts that harden too early and make us commit to views and beliefs that could be wrong.

---

## Reframe: what closure is actually for

Have in mind that closure is not about correctness, but about the stopping point. When do you stop evaluating your beliefs? This is a tough question, and answering it is not easy.

Good closure is:

- Provisional
- Tied to action
- Revisable without identity cost

You can always revise your beliefs. None of them should be terminal. You should use action to test your beliefs, but you don't have to commit to a belief just because you acted upon it in the past. Feel free to change your mind. It's normal.

---

## Practice prompts

Use one belief you currently treat as settled.

Answer, in writing:

- Why did I stop thinking about this?
- What would realistically reopen the question?
- Do I feel defensive when imagining being wrong?
- Am I confusing “this works for now” with “this is true”?

If closure cannot survive these questions, it is probably premature.

---

## What not to overcorrect into

This module is **not** advocating:

- Endless skepticism
- Paralysis by analysis
- Refusal to commit

The target here is _disciplined provisionality_. You don't want to be in perpetual doubt, that's exhausting. If you never settle, you drift. But you don't want to take any belief as fully settled without good reasons for that; if you settle too early, you calcify.

The skill is stopping **for the right reason**.

---

## Completion condition

You have completed this module when you:

- Identify one belief you treat as settled
- Explicitly mark it as provisional
- Clarify what would justify revisiting it
- Notice reduced defensiveness when it is challenged

At that point, closure becomes a tool for good critical thinking.
