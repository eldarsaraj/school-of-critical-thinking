## What this module is for

This module addresses a common source of confusion in reasoning.

Imagine you are discussing a real problem (for example, bad work habits, a struggling relationship, inequality, education outcomes, a failing organization, racism, etc). You notice that the conversation shifts constantly between different levels of abstraction.

At one moment, the focus is on personal responsibility and character. At another, it its on the economy, systems, or cultural forces. The arguments seem to contradict each other.

But, often they do not.

What may happen is that they operate at different **levels**.

The goal of this module is to help you distinguish levels of explanation so you can reason clearly about what follows from each.

## The core mistake

The mistake here is treating explanations at different levels as if they were competing answers to the same question.

For example:

- “He failed because he lacked discipline.”
- “He failed because the system is stacked against him.”

These statements may describe different layers of the same situation, not mutually exclusive claims.

Here, one concerns individual behavior, and the other some structural elements.

When levels are mixed in a conversation or disagreement like this, then:

- Debates become moralized
- Action becomes unclear
- Solutions are proposed at the wrong scale

The result is tension without any purpose. There are not clear actionable ideas about what to do.

---

## Key idea 1: Different levels answer different questions

An individual-level explanation answers:

- Why did this person act the way they did?

A situational explanation answers:

- What immediate pressures or motivations shaped that action?

A systemic explanation answers:

- What broader structures make this pattern likely?

Confusion arises when one level is used to dismiss the relevance of another.

Clarity begins when you ask **which question you are trying to answer**.

---

## Key idea 2: Solutions must match levels

If the problem is framed at the systemic level, individual advice may feel naïve.

If the problem is framed at the individual level, structural reform may feel irrelevant.

Both can be valid concerns, but they lead to different forms of intervention.

Without distinguishing levels, you risk:

- Blaming individuals for structural constraints
- Ignoring personal agency in the name of structure
- Proposing changes that do not target the actual mechanism

Matching the level of explanation to the level of action is essential.

---

## Key idea 3: Level shifts can be rhetorical

In disagreement, people often shift levels intentionally. They may use this as a rhetorical device to make you accept their point.

For example, when individual responsibility is criticized, someone may shift to systemic causes. When systems are criticized, someone may shift back to personal accountability.

I'm sure you discussed things with people who do this (at least I have, in the golden age of Facebook).

The aim of these shifts is to protect positions rather than clarify them.

Noticing when the level changes mid-argument helps prevent circular debates and keeps you resilient to intentional rhetoric.

## The level-labeling exercise (skill drill)

Take a problem you have recently discussed.

Write:

1. What is the individual-level explanation?
2. What is the situational-level explanation?
3. What is the systemic-level explanation?
4. Which level is most relevant for the decision I need to make?

Seeing the layers side by side often reduces confusion.

---

## Common failure patterns

You may recognize some of these:

- Treating systemic explanations as excuses
- Treating individual explanations as blame
- Moving between levels without noticing
- Feeling that everything is complex but not knowing what to do

These patterns often arise from mixing analysis with moral judgment.

---

## Reframe: what levels are actually for

Levels of explanation are tools for clarity.

They help you decide:

- Where intervention is possible
- Who bears responsibility for what
- What kind of change is realistic

You want to keep the levels distinct, so the disagreements you have with others are more precise and more focused.

---

## Practice prompts

Choose a current issue you care about.

Write:

- At what level am I usually thinking about this?
- What level am I neglecting?
- What kind of action corresponds to each level?
- Which level is actionable for me right now?

This exercise often reveals that some arguments are misdirected. See if that applies to your example.

---

## What not to overcorrect into

A word of warning: this module is not suggesting that all levels are equally important in every situation.

Some problems are primarily systemic. Others are primarily individual.

So, the goal is to recognize which is which, and to stop conflating them.

Clarity requires separation before integration. This is called 'decomposition' in computer science, and it's one of the most important critical thinking methods.

---

## Completion condition

You have completed this module when you:

- Can distinguish between individual, situational, and systemic explanations
- Notice when debates shift levels
- Match proposed actions to the level they address

When you complete it, complexity will become strucured rather than overwhelming.
