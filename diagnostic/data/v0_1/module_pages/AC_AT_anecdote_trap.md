## What this module is for

This module addresses a very common cognitive pull.

You hear a vivid example (say, a friend who changed careers and became happier, someone who invested early and made a fortune, a story about a side effect that ruined someone’s health) and the example sticks.

You feel it as real and concrete. You can almost picture it.

Because it is easy to imagine, it starts to influence your judgment more than general statistics, base rates, or abstract advice.

The goal of this module is to help you use examples without letting them dictate your conclusions.

---

## The core mistake

The mistake is treating a vivid case as **representative**.

Of course, anecdotes are not completely useless. They often contain important detail, and they can sometimes alert us to risks or opportunities we hadn’t considered before.

But a single case does not tell you how common something is, how likely it is to happen to you, or what conditions made it possible.

When an anecdote becomes the main evidence, then:

- Rare outcomes feel normal or likely
- Common outcomes fade into the background, we lose the baseline for comparison
- Emotional weight replaces actual frequency

You end up reasoning from memorability rather than prevalence. But, you don't want that. You need to be more deliberate and scientific in your reasoning.

---

## Key idea 1: Memorability is not frequency

Events that are dramatic, unusual, or emotionally intense are easier to remember and easier to retell. A bad experience stays longer in your mind than thousands neutral ones.

Because these kinds of events are easy to retrieve from memory, they feel common.

But ease of recall is not a reliable guide to how often something happens.

This is especially relevant in domains like:

- Health decisions
- Investing
- Parenting
- Career changes

The stories that circulate most widely are often the extremes.

---

## Key idea 2: Context makes the difference

Even when an anecdote is true, it is embedded in a context. Nothing exists outside of some context.

A person who succeeded in a particular move may have:

- Unique timing
- Unusual resources
- Hidden support
- Different constraints

When you absorb the story but not the context, you import the outcome without the conditions.

The key idea here is that examples merely suggest possibilities. They do not automatically justify replication. A single swallow does not indicate that the spring has arrived.

---

## Key idea 3: Examples are hypotheses, not conclusions

Anecdotes are often useful as prompts.

They can lead you to ask:

- Is this more common than I thought?
- Under what conditions does this happen?
- What does broader evidence say?

Used this way, an example opens inquiry. This is what you want. But, you don't want to jump on the wagon of an isolated example to make more general conclusions. Critical thinkers need more than that.

---

## The reference-class check (skill drill)

Take a vivid example that has influenced your thinking.

Write:

1. How typical is this case?
2. What broader group does it belong to?
3. How many similar cases end differently?
4. What information would help estimate how common this outcome is?

This shifts your attention from the story to the distribution.

---

## Common failure patterns

You may recognize some of these:

- Making decisions based on a single dramatic case
- Overestimating rare risks because they are easy to imagine
- Underestimating common risks because they are boring
- Treating one personal success story as a blueprint

These patterns are reinforced by media, conversations with friends, TikTok and Instagram trends.

You're not necessarily irrational if you fall for these. This is just how memory works.

But, memory is not a processing organ: it's a storage. Critical thinkers use it, but do not let it dictate their beliefs and actions.

---

## Reframe: what examples are actually for

Examples make abstract ideas concrete. That's why they're good.

They help us understand mechanisms and imagine possibilities.

But: they are not meant to determine frequency or probability on their own.

So, before drawing conclusions, place the example inside a wider frame.

Ask what **usually happens**, not just what happened once.

---

## Practice prompts

Choose an example that has recently influenced you.

Write:

- Why did this case feel persuasive?
- What information about frequency is missing?
- How would my decision change if this were one case among hundreds?
- What larger pattern should I investigate before acting?

The aim is situate the example within a broader frame.

---

## What not to overcorrect into

A word of warning: this module is not suggesting that anecdotes should be ignored.

Some important warnings enter public awareness through individual cases.

The problem occurs when vividness substitutes for proportion and statistical thinking. Balance requires both the story and the distribution.

---

## Completion condition

You have completed this module when you:

- Notice when a vivid example is driving your judgment
- Ask about base rates or broader patterns before concluding
- Feel less compelled by single cases without dismissing them

You want the examples to be informative, not decisive. You are the decider, examples are just external events that either help or hinder your path to truth. Hold the reins of that path.
