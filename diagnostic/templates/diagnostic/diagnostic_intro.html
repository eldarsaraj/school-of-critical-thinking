  <h1>Thinking Diagnostic</h1>

  <p>Thanks for taking the time to do this diagnostic.</p>

  <p>Before you start, here are a few things to keep in mind about what it is and how to use it.</p>  
  
  <p>
    First, <strong>this is not a personality quiz</strong>, and it’s not a “what type are you” game.
    It’s a stress test for reasoning: you’ll be placed into short scenarios and asked to choose what you’d actually do or infer.
    The goal is to locate <em>where</em> your thinking tends to break under pressure. It's not a judgment of your intelligence or potential.
  </p>

  <p>
    Most people fail because they’re using the wrong mental move for the situation. This doesn't happen becuse they're unintelligent.
    Sometimes they freeze until certainty arrives; sometimes they close too early and defend a story; 
    sometimes they confuse description for explanation, or correlation for leverage.
  </p>
    
    <p>This diagnostic is built to detect those failure modes directly.</p>

  <p>
    The framework behind it has been refined in real classrooms and through years of research into how people think and learn. It’s a carefully designed path that leads to a diagnosis of your thinking.
    What you'll get from this is not an academic exercise: the point is to produce an actionable diagnosis you can use immediately.
  </p>

        Answer honestly. Don’t pick what sounds sophisticated. Pick what you’d actually do.
        If you try to perform intelligence, you’ll get a flattering result and a useless plan.
      </p>
      <p class="start__text" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
        At the end, you’ll get a short diagnosis and a personalized syllabus: a primary module to start with,
        and a secondary module to remove the next constraint once you begin applying the first.
